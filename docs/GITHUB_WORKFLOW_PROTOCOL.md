# GitHub Workflow Protocol

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** November 18, 2025  
**Purpose:** Ensure code quality and stability by testing all changes on a secondary branch before merging to main

---

## 📋 Overview

This protocol establishes a standardized workflow for uploading code to GitHub, ensuring that all updates are thoroughly tested on a secondary branch before being merged into the main branch. This prevents breaking changes from affecting production and maintains code quality.

---

## 🔄 Workflow Steps

### **Step 1: Create a New Branch for Testing**

#### 1.1 Ensure You're on Main Branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

#### 1.2 Create a New Feature/Test Branch

```bash
# For feature development
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# For bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-description

# For testing/experimentation
git checkout -b test/your-test-description

# For refactoring
git checkout -b refactor/your-refactor-description
```

#### 1.3 Push Branch to Remote

```bash
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

**Branch Naming Conventions:**

- `feature/` - New features or enhancements
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `test/` - Testing or experimentation
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

**Example Branch Names:**

- `feature/checkout-improvements`
- `fix/payment-timeout-issue`
- `test/delivery-validation`
- `refactor/cart-context`

---

### **Step 2: Develop and Test on Secondary Branch**

#### 2.1 Make Your Changes

- Write code following project standards
- Add comments where necessary
- Follow TypeScript/React best practices

#### 2.2 Commit Changes Regularly

```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add delivery address validation

- Implemented Mapbox geocoding integration
- Added 8-second timeout for validation
- Added non-blocking error handling
- Updated UI with validation feedback"

# Push to remote branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

**Commit Message Format:**

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)

#### 2.3 Run Local Tests

```bash
# Run build to check for errors
npm run build

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Run unit tests (if available)
npm run test

# Run E2E tests (if available)
npm run test:e2e
```

#### 2.4 Test Functionality Manually

- Test all affected features
- Test edge cases
- Test error scenarios
- Test on different browsers/devices (if applicable)
- Verify no regressions in existing functionality

4. Delete feature branch (optional but recommended)

#### 7.3 Post-Merge Steps

```bash
# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

npm run build
npm run lint

# Delete local feature branch (optional)
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
```

## 🚨 Emergency Hotfix Protocol

For critical production issues that need immediate fixes:

### Quick Fix Process

1. **Create hotfix branch from main:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue-name
   ```

2. **Make minimal fix:**
   - Fix only the critical issue
   - Test thoroughly but quickly
   - Commit and push

3. **Fast-track merge:**
   - Create PR with `[HOTFIX]` prefix
   - Merge immediately after verification
   - Document in post-mortem if needed

4. **Backport to feature branches:**
   - Apply same fix to any active feature branches
   - Prevent regression when those branches merge

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Merge Conflicts

```bash

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git merge main
# Resolve conflicts
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Branch Out of Date

```bash
# Update feature branch with latest main
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
# Resolve any conflicts
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Build Fails After Merge

```bash
# If build fails after merging to main

## ✅ Summary

**Always follow this workflow:**

1. ✅ Create feature branch from main
2. ✅ Develop and test on feature branch
3. ✅ Verify all criteria are met
4. ✅ Create PR with complete description

**Never:**

- ❌ Push directly to main
- ❌ Merge untested code
- ❌ Skip verification steps
- ❌ Merge with failing builds
- ❌ Merge with known bugs
