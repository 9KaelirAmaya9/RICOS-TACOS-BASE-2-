# ✅ Guest Checkout Fix

## Problem Identified

Guest checkout wasn't working because:

- Customer info validation schema allowed empty strings
- Payment function requires name, phone, and email
- Users could click "Continue as Guest" without filling required fields
- No clear validation feedback before proceeding

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Required Field Validation** ✅

- Changed validation schema to **require** name, phone, and email
- Name: minimum 2 characters
- Phone: minimum 10 digits
- Email: must be valid email format

### 2. **Real-Time Validation Feedback** ✅

- Shows error messages under fields as user types
- Highlights invalid fields with red border
- Prevents proceeding with invalid data

### 3. **Pre-Checkout Validation** ✅

- Validates customer info **before** showing auth options
- Shows specific error messages
- Focuses on the field with error
- User must fill required fields first

### 4. **Better Error Messages** ✅

- "Please enter your name (at least 2 characters)"
- "Please enter a valid phone number (at least 10 digits)"
- "Please enter a valid email address"
- "Please enter a delivery address" (for delivery orders)

## What Changed

- Cannot proceed without valid data
- Errors shown immediately
- Clear, helpful error messages
- Field-level validation feedback

**Guest checkout is now fixed and working! ✅**

The issue was that validation wasn't strict enough - now it properly requires customer information before allowing checkout.
