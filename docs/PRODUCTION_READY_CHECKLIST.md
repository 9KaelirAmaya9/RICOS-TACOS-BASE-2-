## 📊 KNOWN ISSUES & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Non-Critical Issues

1. **Bundle Size** (2.5MB)
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Recommendation**: Code splitting, image optimization
   - **Priority**: Medium

2. **Dependency Vulnerabilities** (2 moderate)
   - **Impact**: Low (dev dependencies only)
   - **Recommendation**: Monitor, update when ready
   - **Priority**: Low

3. **TypeScript Strict Mode** (disabled)
   - **Impact**: Low
   - **Recommendation**: Enable gradually
   - **Priority**: Low

### Optimizations Recommended

1. **Image Optimization**
   - Compress large images (logo: 1.8MB)
   - Use WebP format
   - Lazy load images

2. **Code Splitting**
   - Route-based splitting
   - Dynamic imports for heavy components

3. **Bundle Analysis**
   - Run bundle analyzer
   - Identify large dependencies
   - Optimize imports
