# Guest Checkout Troubleshooting

## What I Just Fixed

### 1. **Made Delivery Validation Non-Blocking** ✅

- Added 5-second timeout for delivery validation
- If validation fails or times out, checkout continues anyway
- Prevents delivery validation from blocking guest checkout

### 2. **Added Extensive Logging** ✅

- Logs when "Continue as Guest" button is clicked
- Logs when `handlePlaceOrder` is called
- Logs validation steps
- Logs order creation
- Logs payment intent creation

### 3. **Better Error Handling** ✅

- Try-catch around delivery validation
- Non-blocking errors
- Clear console messages

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Continue as Guest button clicked" but nothing else

**Problem:** Function not being called
**Fix:** Check if `onContinueAsGuest` prop is passed correctly

### Issue: "handlePlaceOrder CALLED" but stops at validation

**Problem:** Validation failing
**Fix:** Check validation error message in console

### Issue: "Order created successfully" but payment fails

**Problem:** Payment function issue
**Fix:** Check payment intent error in console

### Issue: No logs at all

**Problem:** Button not working or page not loaded
**Fix:** Check if page is fully loaded, try refreshing

## Quick Test

**Try PICKUP first** (no delivery validation):

1. Select "Pickup" tab
2. Fill in name, phone, email
3. Click "Proceed to Checkout"
4. Click "Guest" tab
5. Click "Continue as Guest"

If pickup works but delivery doesn't, it's a delivery validation issue.

## What to Share

Please share:

1. **All console logs** (copy everything from console)
2. **The exact error message** (if any)
3. **Whether it's pickup or delivery**
4. **What happens** (nothing? error? loading forever?)

The logs will show EXACTLY where it's failing! 🔍
